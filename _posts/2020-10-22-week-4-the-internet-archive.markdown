## The Interent Archive ##
This week’s visit was to The Internet Archive, Archive.org. The Internet Archive - who describe themselves as a “digital library”  is a non profit organization and was created in 1996 and initially started by archiving the internet. This has allowed them to grow a collection of 475 billion web pages, accessible through the *wayback machine*, compiled over almost twenty five years.  The Internet Archive claims their mission is to “provide Universal Access to All Knowledge.” The Archive itself does this by providing an archive with access to not only web pages but also: 28 million books and texts, 14 million audio recordings (including 220,000 live concerts), 6 million videos (including 2 million Television News programs), 3.5 million images and     580,000 software programs.

The collections are sourced from both users and the archive itself. That is to say that the archive allows users who have created accounts to upload their own content and the people who work for the archive also digitise a great number of  books and documents- the archive claims they scan “1000 books per day in 28 locations around the world”. Though the Open Library Project justifies its operation through fair use laws and not making commercial profit from the materials they share, there have been  claims of copyright infringement, most recently by publishers including HarperCollins and Hachette.

As claimed on their website, the archive is essentially made for anyone seeking access to knowledge. The library in particular has a wide range of books on subjects ranging from quantum physics to 15th century travel literature. All users have to do is know what they want to look for.
The Archive is supported by donations from the public and various grants. Another key source of support for the archive comes from its partnerships with various libraries and universities such as Stanford University. The Archive relies on the support of its employed workers, web crawlers and the public in order to curate such a large collection.

The collections are organised according to their category: web, books, video, audio, software and images. The site employs metadata including: publication date, topics, collection, language and author. Though on some pages there are more categories and this is a longer section.
Most of the multimedia files on the archive tend to be embedded .avi or .flac files, however, where they are not, especially for audio files the archive allows users to listen through webamp.
