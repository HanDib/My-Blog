## Google Arts and Culture
This week’s focus was the Google Arts and Culture webpage. This is an interesting site with a lot of fun, and interactive content. 
The website features many different articles that cover many things to do with arts and culture, and this includes everything from pieces on artists such as Georgia O’Keefe to *6 Places that changed the world*. These articles are fully interactive and in the latter’s case, work in tandem with Google Maps street view allowing visitors to ‘move’ around within each place.

 ### Interactive Museums
 The site also allows visitors access to museums and galleries around the world. One of which is the *Museu de Arte de São Paulo*. As with last week’s virtual tour of The British Museum, visitors can also move around in the museum and interact with the collection as though they are in the museum.Interestingly as well as Google Maps Street View, visitors can do this using Augmented Reality with  the aid of the *Art Projector* app. In addition to this, the site allows you to interact with the paintings in the gallery as it displays the names of the painting which then link to a digitised version with additional information such as the size and provenance. The site also recommends other paintings by the artist and other visually similar paintings.Visitors can ‘like’ these paintings thereby adding them to their favourites to be revisited at any time or added to their own personal galleries.
